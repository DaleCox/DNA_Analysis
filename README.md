DNA Analysis Library
================

This is a JavaScript Library that can be used to analyze DNA. I'm in the process of creating samples for the individual functions. 

I have a sample that shows the Skew of the DNA strand that is being looked at. 

TODO List:
- Add More Samples
- Add DNA strand generator 
- Couple more functions are needed in the library 
-- RNA conversion 
-- Clump finding
-- a couple more functions around DNA Skew analysis
--- List of possible OriC 
- Scale the algorithms with web workers 
--- thinking B-Tree approach 2 steps (I have 4 logical cores on my client machine)
